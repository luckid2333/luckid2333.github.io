This study investigates whether helping colleagues in a competitive work environment can be strategically used as a signal of one's ability and how others respond. 
A novel real-effort lab experiment was conducted where two workers compete for one position and one worker can help the other at a cost. 
Two treatments, Signal and Baseline, vary in the timing of whether the helping decisions are observed before or after employers make hiring decisions. 
The findings show that workers indeed help their competitors to signal their abilities. Employers can recognize this signal and are more likely to hire those who help. 
Remarkably, no matter whether the help harms the recipient's prospect of being hired, those who provide the help are equally likely to be rewarded by the competing worker. 
This study provides insights into how strategic motives encourage employees to help their colleagues, even in competitive work environments.
