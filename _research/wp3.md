We study whether other-regarding preferences of the majority population in Germany and the Netherlands depend on the ethnic background of others. 
To do so, we ran large-scale controlled experiments among the general majority population in both countries. 
The participants' main task was to make a series of choices on allocating money between themselves and another participant, or between two other participants. 
Part of the decision-makers were matched with others who also belonged to the majority population, and another part of the decision-makers were matched with others who belonged to an ethnic minority group. 
The choices were constructed with the purpose of structurally estimating the parameters of a utility function that allows for a variety of other-regarding preferences, including altruism, inequality aversion, spite, and welfare maximization. 
We find that, overall, none of the other-regarding preferences depends on the ethnic background of the other.
