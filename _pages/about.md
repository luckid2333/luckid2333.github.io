I am a postdoctoral associate at the Center for Behavioral Institutional Design (C-BID), at New York University Abu Dhabi. I received my PhD in Economics at Tilburg University in November 2024.  


My research fields are Behavioral Economics and Experimental Economics. I study coordination games, human responses to AI interactions, other-regarding preferences, ethnic discrimination, and costly signaling.
