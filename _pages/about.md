I am now a PhD student in Economics at Tilburg University, starting from September 2019, majoring in Behavioral and Experimental Economics. 

My supervisor is Prof.dr.Sigrid Suetens.

My current research interests are related, but not limited to social identity and its effects on decision making, aimed at better interpreting human behavior and promoting social welfare by mechanism designs or behavioral nudges. My research target is putting behavioral economics to work in the real world, where theory can meet application. 

I am now working on a project about discrimination with my supervisor.
